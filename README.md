## Adding TEMP/BUSD Liquidity
Tx link: https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x1fde551a57480a3c73f813df73944dae4390ebf65f20cd0de4cd2647ad029b3b

## Buying TEMP from another wallet
Tx link: https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x8c3e3ed639340e65b8ad21ee77ba0ccd7a4c80f796565a36703c17164c229b89

You will notice that the buyers bought with BNB, which was swapped to DAI, then to BUSD, and then to TEMP.
Also notice that there is no tax on this transaction ðŸ˜²

## Remove TEMP/BUSD Liquidity
Tx link: https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x71660f603ac4d2fd13f6e92f8ac84b4019f83a06ee106d66606539302adc77a8

## Buying TEMP from another wallet (again)
Tx link: https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x67acbd795ded45eb15a84cf4de0633d8da20ded990d5631c60cc970f5f3cf40f

This time, it was a direct swap from the TEMP/BNB pool (since there's no liquidity in the TEMP/BUSD pool), and a fee of 12% applied.

## Selling TEMP
Tx link: https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0xc5fc323a8d98e99a7fb6d01019a4c3ed1ac37a05c9e7f72acdce0b67cdc85607

We can see a fee of 12% applied. Moreover, all holders got reflection, and the vault/marketing wallets got their share of BNB.
